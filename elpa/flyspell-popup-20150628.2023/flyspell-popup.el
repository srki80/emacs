;; Correct the misspelled word with `flyspell' in popup menu.
;;
;; Usage
;; =====
;;
;; To use, put your cursor on or after the misspelled word and call
;; `flyspell-popup-correct'. You can of course bind it to a key as well by adding
;; this to your Emacs initialization file, e.g. ~/.emacs.d/init.el:
;;
;;   (define-key flyspell-mode-map (kbd "C-;") #'flyspell-popup-correct)

;;; Code:

(require 'flyspell)
(require 'popup)

;;;###autoload
(defun flyspell-popup-correct ()
  "Use popup for flyspell correction.
Adapted from `flyspell-correct-word-before-point'."
  (interactive)
  ;; use the correct dictionary
  (flyspell-accept-buffer-local-defs)
  (let ((cursor-location (point))
        (word (flyspell-get-word))
