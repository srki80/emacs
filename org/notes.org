*** The build "script" consist out of three different parts.
    1. The run.sh
       - Get the input from the user.
       - Manipulate master script using sed. 
       - Run ftp_build_script and upload master script to each build host.
       - Fire up gnome-terminal with 5 tabs (one for each host) set title and
         run scripts to initiate telnet session. 
    2. The master script build_axux.sh. 
       - Check for .cvsrc and m script. Remove aventx source directory if
         exist. Pull source from CVS tree, tag the source, change directory and
         start compiling.
       - In case that anything fails, send email alert.
    3. The ftp_build_script.sh.
       - This script upload master build script to each build host.
    4. The connector scripts o_hostname.
       - Connector scripts are the expect scripts responsible for creating
         telnet session with build hosts. 

** TODO Changes to be made on the build "script" <2013-07-15 Mon>
*** TODO Create the build directory in format 'date_aventx'.
*** TODO Clean up after the build is done.
*** TODO Check if DEBUG is set in m script.
*** TODO Pull the source using TAG instead of tagging.

    
* General Notes
** Why store passwords for development in a word file? 
   - Too many steps to get to the password file.
   - Inefficient word search. (why not grep)
   - Create text password table.
   - Encrypt it with 256-bit AES encryption in CBC mode.
     - openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in pass.txt -out passfile
   - Decrypt script givepass will have openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -in
     passfile. This will print out to STDOUT decrypted content of the pass
     file. (It will not remove encryption from encrypted file). In conjunction
     with grep you'll have password in few seconds.
