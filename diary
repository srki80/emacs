    Spent most of the day trying to figure out the installation process of AXOC.

  - ChangeRequests: Upgrade from a version lower than 7.8.00 fails if Work Order doctype does not exist.
    
    Tried to reproduce with the 7.8 to 7.9 upgrade. Upgraded completed with no errors.
    Found that Work Order was included first in AXOC 6.1. 
    Tried to reproduce with the 6.0 to 7.8 upgrade. Upgrade completed with no errors.
    Aquired an input from Ted. Based on his input, next step installing AXOC 5.4 upgrading to 6.4 to 7.9.

< B2663:
  - ChangeRequests: Syntax for Call to fcjTime.jar is Incorrect for Java Version 7. Corrected the
  syntax and added it to the AXOC branch v8-2-01_branch_srki

< B2677:
  - Installed AXOC 5.4, confirmed that Work Order doctype not present, upgraded to 6.4 and found
  that Work Order doctype was added as expected. 
  
  - As I've expected the upgrade from 6.4 to 7.9 finished with no errors. I will still try to add
    defensive code against the missing Work Order condition.
